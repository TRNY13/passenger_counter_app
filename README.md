# passenger_counter_app

Passenger Counter App is a simple Javascript application used to count passengers (or anything really). With it being a simple counting application, the uses fall under counting objects.
The user will click the increment button to count passengers(or any object) and hit the save button whenever they need to save that log. The log of saved objects is stored in the console and 
on the page. Afterwards, the count is reset to zero and the user can continue to start new logs of counts.

This application uses HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. This project is the first step in me completing the Front-End Developer Career Path from https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend. 
The code used in the project takes inspiration from the Passenger Counter App tutorial on the Scrimba platform.
